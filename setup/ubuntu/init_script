  # NOTE: each distribution upgrade has resulted in changing the search logic
  # to find the largest disk attached to create /media/ephemeral0/ubuntu.  In
  # this formulation we rely on `lsblk` reporting type `disk` for the desired
  # destination drive, which may not always be true.  Example standard outputs:
  #
  # Focal:
  # $ lsblk
  # NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  # ... loop devices ...
  # nvme1n1     259:0    0 372.5G  0 disk
  # nvme0n1     259:1    0    16G  0 disk
  # └─nvme0n1p1 259:2    0    16G  0 part /
  #
  # Jammy:
  # NAME         MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
  # ... loop devices ...
  # nvme0n1      259:0    0     8G  0 disk
  # ├─nvme0n1p1  259:2    0   7.9G  0 part /
  # ├─nvme0n1p14 259:3    0     4M  0 part
  # └─nvme0n1p15 259:4    0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
  # nvme1n1      259:1    0 372.5G  0 disk
  #
  # In both instances we desire `/dev/nvme1n1`, which is the largest disk
  # storage attached.  The pipeline below executes:
  #
  # 1. `lsblk` to query SIZE (in bytes via -b to enable sorting), NAME, and
  #    TYPE, output in key="value" pairs (-P) to make `sed` more reliable.
  # 2. Filter for just the `disk` types using `grep`.
  # 3. Transform remaining `SIZE="size" NAME="name" TYPE="type"` lines into
  #    `size:name` using `sed` to enable sorting on `size` and easy `name`
  #    extraction via `cut`.
  # 4. Numerically sort in reverse the output (`sort -nr`), meaning the largest
  #    `disk` will be the first line, and select the largest (`head -1`).
  # 5. Finally, extract `name` from `size:name` via `cut`, producing a final
  #    result of `/dev/{name}` to create the additional storage on.
