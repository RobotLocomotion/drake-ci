# Rotate logs if they grow past 100MB, or each month, whichever is first.
# Note that the /opt/cache_server/log/nginx/access.log in particular grows very
# quickly.  Logs are rotated hourly as a result, otherwise you can end up with
# an access.log of >5GB.
#
# Logs will be rotated 10 times and then deleted.
#
# Note that the cron job running this is expected to execute daily.
